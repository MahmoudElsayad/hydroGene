# hydroGene

## What is hydroGene?
**hydroGene** is an open-source platform for bioinformatics that aims to show a **fast bitwise protein sequence alignment algorithm** implemented in javascript that's inspired from (https://github.com/keithwhor/NtSeq "NtSeq"), it also offers some different algorithms for comparison purposes that's implemented in javascript too.

### What is Sequence Alignment?
It is a way of arranging the sequences of DNA, RNA, or protein to identify regions of similarity that may be a consequence of functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships between the sequences.

### What can you do with hydroGene?
1- Align 2 sequences together for best alignment results in a much faster ways of traditional alignment algorithms.
2- Basic operations from (https://github.com/bionode/bionode#readme "bionode").
3- Live retrieval of NCBI database.
4- Export alignment results in various file formats using 

### How to use hydroGene?
1- Run the node express server locally, and you can test the whole platform.
2- Run only the hydrogene.js file, after changing seq1 & seq2 with the desired input.


### Why hydroGene?
Hydrogen is the simplest substance in existence consisting of exactly one atom, making it the easiest to be studied, the project aims to introduce the complicated concepts of bioninformatics in an easy manner for normal users to understand.
