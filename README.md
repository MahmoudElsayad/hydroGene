# hydroGene

## What is hydroGene?
**hydroGene** is an open-source platform for bioinformatics that aims to show a **fast bitwise protein sequence alignment algorithm** implemented in javascript that's inspired from (https://github.com/keithwhor/NtSeq "NtSeq"), it also offers some different algorithms for comparison purposes that's implemented in javascript too.

### What is Sequence Alignment?
It is a way of arranging the sequences of DNA, RNA, or protein to identify regions of similarity that may be a consequence of functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships between the sequences.

### What can you do with hydroGene?
1- Align 2 sequences together for best alignment results in a much faster ways of traditional alignment algorithms.
2- Basic operations from (https://github.com/bionode/bionode#readme "bionode").
3- Live retrieval of NCBI database.
4- Export alignment results in various file formats using
